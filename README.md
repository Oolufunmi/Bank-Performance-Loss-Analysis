# Bank-Performance-Loss-Analysis

Tableau on Bank Performance Analysis
Excited to share that I just completed a Tableau course, which included a mini-project analyzing bank losses from 2010–2012.

Using Tableau for analysis and visualization was a great experience! 🤩

I realized that my Excel knowledge made learning Tableau much easier and intuitive.✨

Tableau has been the easiest analytical tool for me so far 💃

If you're looking to enhance your data visualization skills, I highly recommend 'From Excel to Tableau' by Heather Johnson 👉🏾 (https://bit.ly/4brg3Ac)
